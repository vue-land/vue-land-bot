:wave: Welcome!

If you're looking for help with Vue then you've come to the right place!

We've written this guide to explain how to ask for help. You should find that most of it is common sense but please read it carefully before you ask a question. You're much more likely to receive a helpful answer if you follow the advice given here.

---

Before asking a question on this Discord, check the <#505423005929832468> channel to see whether there is a more appropriate Discord for your question.

---

**Picking a channel**

:exclamation: Please only ask in one channel.

For some questions it isn't obvious which channel to use, especially if you don't know what the problem is. Take your time to look through the channels and try to pick the one you think is the best fit.

---

Some tips for finding the best channel...

:one: If your question is about tools then try to ask in one of the `Tools` channels. :tools:
:two: If you need help with your code then try under `Code Help`.
:three: If you want to discuss something but don't need help with your code then one of the channels under `Discussions` might be best.
:four: If you have a question about using a non-Vue library like axios, consider asking in <#708275453193879554> or <#331999220125138944>.

As you might imagine, a lot of questions end up in either <#325479107012067328> or <#568340117052456970>. Please check carefully which version of Vue you're using before posting.

**How to ask a good question**

Beginners are very welcome <:spock_vue:326303792804921345>. Please don't be afraid to ask a question because you're new. We all started the same way.

---

Keep in mind that you are being helped by volunteers :teacher:. If your question is difficult to understand or shows a lack of effort then you probably won't get any help.

---

You should research your question before you ask. Try searching the web and reading the relevant Vue guides before you post here. Don't skip steps in the hope of getting a quicker answer.

---

We aren't mind readers :brain:. A good question needs to make it clear what the problem is. We don't know what your application does or what you're expecting your code to do. Never describe the problem as 'it doesn't work'. Explain what you're trying to do and what is happening instead.

---

If you're having a problem with your code then we'll need to see the code to be able to help you fix it. Please don't post hundreds of lines of code. Take the time to reduce it down to only the parts that are directly relevant to your question. Verify that the problem still occurs in the simplified code before you post it.

---

Please post code as text, not as a screenshot. We need to be able to edit the text to make suggestions. Code blocks should be posted within triple backticks, similar to markdown. e.g.:

```
​`​​`​`​js
// JavaScript code here
`​​`​`​
```

Tools like JSFiddle, CodeSandbox, CodePen, and the Vue 3 SFC Playground can be used to create runnable examples that demonstrate your problem. These make it much easier for us to see and debug the problem ourselves. Creating a minimal, runnable example like this is also a great way to solve the problem yourself.

---

You should also let us know if there are any warnings or errors in your browser's console. If you do see an error, please try searching the web before you ask on Discord.

---

Proof-read your question before you post it. Check that you wrote what you intended to write and that your question isn't ambiguous or easily misinterpreted.

---

:exclamation: Please **DO NOT** ask questions like these:

:small_orange_diamond: Hello. Can anybody help me?
:small_orange_diamond: Is there anybody here?
:small_orange_diamond: Can I ask a question?
:small_orange_diamond: Does anyone have any experience with X?
:small_orange_diamond: Can X be integrated with Y?
:small_orange_diamond: Why am I just getting a white screen?

These aren't proper questions. We can't tell what you really want to know. People won't volunteer to help you without knowing what the problem is. See <https://www.nohello.net/> and <https://dontasktoask.com/> for more details about why.

---

Try to be realistic when asking a question. Questions that need an experienced developer to spend hours studying your system are unlikely to get a good answer. Instead, focus your question on a specific, small problem that other people will likely be able to understand quickly.

---

**Other advice**

:one: Never `@` tag people unless they are already involved in answering your question.
:two: The people helping you will usually be typing code directly into Discord. They probably haven't run it. Don't expect it to work perfectly. You need to study it and understand it, not just copy it.
:three: Try to wait for a channel to go quiet before posting your question. If you ask in the middle of another conversation your question may just get lost.
:four: Don't describe your question as 'urgent' or 'important' or anything else that implies your question should be given higher priority. You'll generally find that people are less likely to help you if you demand immediate assistance.
:five: Don't post questions just before you need to rush off. Most questions will need further input from you before reaching a final answer.
:six: Try to avoid asking questions when you're tired and/or frustrated. Give yourself time to calm down or come back to the problem after some sleep. The help channels are not the right place to vent your frustrations.
:seven: If your question goes unanswered for several hours then feel free to bump it. Post a 'reply' to the original post, politely asking whether anyone is able to help. A question can easily get lost if there are lots of other questions being asked. Please be patient and don't keep asking the same question over and over again. If no-one is answering then it could be that your question isn't clear, or perhaps it's just that nobody knows the answer.
:eight: Try to keep all conversations in the public channels rather than using DMs. DMs prevent other people from helping. You are more likely to receive bad advice or be targeted by a scammer if you use DMs.

---

:ribbon: Bonus: help other people! Don't be afraid to answer questions from other people. We all have knowledge that's valuable and we all need help sometimes.
